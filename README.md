## Introduction

**Art Gallery** is a web application featuring a collection of interactive and visually engaging projects developed using Next.js and React. The project includes dynamic art canvases and simple games that demonstrate creative coding and interactive design principles.

## Features

### Dynamic Art Canvas

An interactive canvas that responds to mouse movements and touch inputs. Users can create dynamic art by moving the cursor or touching the screen, generating shapes with varying sizes and colors based on the speed and direction of the movement.

- **Responsive Drawing:** Reacts to user input in real-time.
- **Dynamic Shapes:** Creates shapes with dynamic sizes and random colors.
- **Clear Functionality:** Allows users to clear the canvas and create new art.

### Bubble Flow

An animated visualization featuring bubbles that move and bounce within the browser window. Users can interact with the bubbles by clicking or touching the screen to create explosion effects that influence the bubbles' trajectories.

- **Animated Bubbles:** Displays bubbles with random colors and movements.
- **Interactive Explosions:** User interactions cause bubbles to change direction dynamically.
- **Pause/Resume Control:** Users can pause and resume the animation as desired.

### Number Puzzle

A simple and engaging number-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a secret number within a certain range. The game provides clues to help the player adjust their guesses.

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users input guesses and receive immediate feedback.
- **Adaptive Range:** The guessing range adjusts based on user input.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the number of attempts made.
